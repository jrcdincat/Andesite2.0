# Andesite2.0

Andesite2.0 is a 2D platformer where the player explores the volcanic wilderness. 
Unlike the first incomplete version of Andesite, Andesite2.0 utilizes `Box2D` physics (https://box2d.org/).


## Plan
By then end of October 2021, Andesite2.0 should have a fully completed one level platformer game.
The .tmx map will be created using `Tiled`(https://www.mapeditor.org/). 
Rendering and audio will be implemented with `Simple DirectMedia Layer` (https://www.libsdl.org/).
